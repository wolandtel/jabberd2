    <!-- Maximum number of file descriptors. This value sets an upper
         limit on the number of users and components connected.

         Note that the number of possible connections will be slightly
         less than this, because daemon itself can use few on its own,
         and auth/reg modules may need a few also. If the supply of
         file descriptors is exhausted, new incoming connections will
         be denied.

         Also note that this value only affects how many file descriptors
         jabberd is able to handle internally. You may also need to
         tell your operating system to allow jabberd to use more file
         descriptors. On Linux this can be done using ulimit -n or by
         changing the value of /proc/sys/fd/file-max.
